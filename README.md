# Image-Encryption-using-AES-Algorithm
Image Encryption using AES Algorithm
Securely encrypt and decrypt images using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) to ensure confidentiality, privacy, and safe data sharing.

📌 Overview
This project demonstrates how to protect digital images from unauthorized access using AES symmetric key encryption. It converts image data into an encrypted format for secure storage or transmission, and allows authorized users to decrypt and restore the original image with the correct key.

✨ Features
🔒 AES-based symmetric encryption and decryption

📷 Works with various image formats (JPEG, PNG, etc.)

📁 Secure storage and transfer of image data

🛡️ Protects against unauthorized access and data breaches

📜 Modular, clean, and well-documented code

🛠️ Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python

Libraries: PyCryptodome, Pillow

Encryption Standard: AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)
